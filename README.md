This repository contains the containerization of the multi-container application illustrated below.

### Overview.
This project containerizes a multi-service application using Docker Compose. It includes:

Movies API: Provides access to movie data.
MongoDB: Stores the applicationâ€™s data persistently.
Redis: Caches data for quick access.
Mongo Express: Web-based MongoDB management tool for development.


### Database Seeding
The MongoDB service is automatically seeded with initial data for testing and development. The data is loaded from a JSON file (seeding.json) and imported into MongoDB when the project starts.

The seeding process is managed by the mongodb-seed service, which runs the following command:

mongoimport --host mongodb --db movies_dbdocker --collection movies --authenticationDatabase admin --username ${MONGODB_USERNAME} --password ${MONGODB_PASSWORD} --drop --jsonArray --file /mongodb-init/seeding.json

This command should import data from seeding.json into the movies collection within the movies_dbdocker database. Altought the seeding seems to run as it should I recieve an empty array when i go to https://localhost:9000/movies and an error in my log : 

mongo-express  | /docker-entrypoint.sh: line 15: /dev/tcp/mongo/27017: Invalid argument

### Multi-Stack
This Docker Compose setup supports both development and production configurations. For development, Mongo Express and MongoDB seeding are included. Production configuration excludes these services.
